                        was also home to the Pythian Games, one of the four major international Greek games, where the 
                        best athletes in the Greek world would compete for the honor of their homelands. There also 
                        lived the Oracles of Delphi, whom kings and commoners alike would beseech for divine advice.

                    lock-and-key, at Delphi. Also, most major Greek city-states had their own cultural shrines

                <p>Beyond all of the the mighty monuments, ornate sculpture, sophisticated artwork, and lavish ritual of 
                    Delphi, a single person would out-shine the rest of Delphi’s legacy. The Pythia was the 
                    title of the high priestess of Delphi, who also served as its primary oracle. The role of 
                    Pythia as spiritual leader of Delphi was established around 1000 B.C., outdating nearly all 
                    of Delphi’s architecture and other traditions.

                        powers of spiritual divination, and she was chosen from among the women of low-birth 
                        in the region. As high priestess, she was widely sought after by kings and commoners 
                        alike for her divine prophecies. The Oracle at Delphi was the most prestigious and 
                        authoritative oracle in classical Greek culture, and the Pythia of the Oracle of Delphi
                        was among the most powerful women of pre-Roman Europe.

                                    the temple was so badly damaged that all accounts we have of the original artwork is

            <div id="theatre-text">
                <p>Similar to the agora (or marketplace), the theatre was an architectural hallmark of ancient 
                    Greek civilization, and theatres can be found in nearly every ancient Greek community. The 
                    theatre at Delphi was built further up the hill from the Temple of Apollo, giving spectators an 
                    unrivaled view of the rest of the sanctuary, and the valley below. 
                </p>
                    <div id="theatre-text">
                        <p>Added to the sanctuary during the 4th Century B.C., the theatre was expanded and 
                            improved several times. The koilon (seating) leans against the natural slope of 
                            the mountain, and is assembled using local white granite. The stage would have 
                            been covered in sand from the nearby shoreline at the Gulf of Corinth, or swept 
                            clean, depending on the demands of the event.

                    ceremony, the sound of running water would have accompanied the verse and poetry being 
                    performed on stage. The theatre continued to be used under Roman control of Greece, 
                    long after the rest of the sanctuary had become obsolete, until probably the early 
                    6th Century A.D.

                    alternative to seeking honor exclusively on the battlefield!

                            held at four-year intervals, offset by two years from each other.

                <p>The Pythian games began as a simi-formal event, including only local athletes, starting 
                    probably about 800 B.C., some 300 years before the Olympic Games. Conducted in the fall 
                    season, the games were held in honor of the Pythia (high priestess) of Delphi, and the 
                    mythological victory of the Hellenic God Apollo over his enemies, the Titans, after a 
                    legendary battle at Delphi. Around 500 B.C., the Panhellenic Games became formalized into 
                    regular competitions with standard rules, and enjoyed wide international participation.

                        <p>The Pythian Stadium started humbly as a mere clearing in the forest, but was improved over 
                            the centuries with koilon (seating) hewn from local granite, and an indoor gymnasium where 
                            the athletes could warm-up before competitions. Ornate stone carvings, bronze statues, 
                            embossed frescos, and other artwork depicting athletic competition and divine victory
                            (as described by contemporary witnesses) has sadly been lost to the ages.
