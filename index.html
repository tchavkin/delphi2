                <p>In an ancient world which brimmed-full with fantastic, larger-than-life architecture 
                    and religious tradition, the glory of ancient Delphi stood out as a crown jewel of 
                    Greek culture.

                        the world, Delphi was a place of peace and high religious ceremony. Delphi 
                        was also home to the Pythian Games, one of the four major international Greek games, where the 
                        best athletes in the Greek world would compete for the honor of their homelands. There also 
                        lived the Oracles of Delphi, whom kings and commoners alike would beseech for divine advice.

                <p>A focal point for international diplomacy at the time, the leagues and kingdoms of the 
                    ancient Greek city-states would provide insurance for 
                    their treaties by leaving some of their finest art and treasures, under 
                    lock-and-key, at Delphi. Also, most major Greek city-states had their own cultural shrines 
                    at Delphi, making it a truly international religious center.

                        there as servants or priestesses – if they needed to flee trouble at home. Today, Delphi 
                        is the location of some of the best-preserved ruins from ancient Greek culture.

                <p>Beyond all of the the mighty monuments, ornate sculpture, sophisticated artwork, and lavish ritual of 
                    Delphi, a single person would out-shine the rest of Delphi’s legacy. The Pythia was the 
                    title of the high priestess of Delphi, who also served as its primary oracle. The role of 
                    Pythia as spiritual leader of Delphi was established around 1000 B.C., outdating nearly all 
                    of Delphi’s architecture and other traditions.

                <div class="delphi-oracle-text-2">
                    <p>Similar to the rest of the priestly class at Delphi, the Pythia would be selected for her 
                        powers of spiritual divination, and she was chosen from among the women of low-birth 
                        in the region. As high priestess, she was widely sought after by kings and commoners 
                        alike for her divine prophecies. The Oracle at Delphi was the most prestigious and 
                        authoritative oracle in classical Greek culture, and the Pythia of the Oracle of Delphi
                        was among the most powerful women of pre-Roman Europe.

                    ancient Greek poet Pindar, the first major temple at the location was likely actually to honor 
                    the Apollo’s sister, the Goddess Dimeter, and was likely made of olive wood and beeswax.

                            the mountain, and is assembled using local white granite. The stage would have 
                            been covered in sand from the nearby shoreline at the Gulf of Corinth, or swept 
                            clean, depending on the demands of the event.

                <p>The eastern side of the koilon abutted a small aqueduct, which caried water from the sacred 
                    Spring of Cassotis to a fountain near the Temple of Apollo. During the play or 
                    ceremony, the sound of running water would have accompanied the verse and poetry being 
                    performed on stage. The theatre continued to be used under Roman control of Greece, 
                    long after the rest of the sanctuary had become obsolete, until probably the early 
                    6th Century A.D.

                <p>While the mountain-top stadium at Delphi was hardly the largest stadium in the classical 
                    Greek world, it certainly was one of the most important. From time immemorable, the nations 
                    of Greece would compete against each other in ritual athletic competitions – a much less destructive 
                    alternative to seeking honor exclusively on the battlefield!

                        <p>Delphi was host to the Pythian Games, an older counterpart to the more famous 
                            Olympic games in the Peloponnese. The Pythian and Olympic Games were both 
                            held at four-year intervals, offset by two years from each other.

                <p>The Pythian games began as a simi-formal event, including only local athletes, starting 
                    probably about 800 B.C., some 300 years before the Olympic Games. Conducted in the fall 
                    season, the games were held in honor of the Pythia (high priestess) of Delphi, and the 
                    mythological victory of the Hellenic God Apollo over his enemies, the Titans, after a 
                    legendary battle at Delphi. Around 500 B.C., the Panhellenic Games became formalized into 
                    regular competitions with standard rules, and enjoyed wide international participation.

                        <p>The Pythian Stadium started humbly as a mere clearing in the forest, but was improved over 
                            the centuries with koilon (seating) hewn from local granite, and an indoor gymnasium where 
                            the athletes could warm-up before competitions. Ornate stone carvings, bronze statues, 
                            embossed frescos, and other artwork depicting athletic competition and divine victory
                            (as described by contemporary witnesses) has sadly been lost to the ages.

                            bronze trumpets would have sounded the opening and closing of each competition.
